Learning GitHub while I'm eating my pancakes &amp; watching NCIS Los Angeles

This is my Hello World GitHub project.  I've started to learn this a few years ago when I was learning Ruby.
It wants me to list changes I made after creating this project:

I'm on my 2nd episode of NICS:LA, 2 of 6 pancakes were delicious, and I broke up 3 arugments between my 2 sons.  

***I'm on a roll today!!!
